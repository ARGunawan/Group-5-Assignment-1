        <p class="centered_text">
            Carbon Footprint is the measure of the impact of human activity from greenhouse gases primarily from carbon dioxide. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ways you can lower your carbon footprint</h2>
        <hr>
            <h3>Food</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consume less meat and dairy. Livestock is responsible for for 14.5% of manmade global greenhouse gas emissions. This is mostly attributed to feed processing and emission of methane from cows and sheeps. Each day you don't eat meat you can reduce your carbon footprint by 8 pounds, which is 2,920 pounds a year</li>
                    <li>Conume organic and local foods. A lot of resources are used to transport food by truck, ship, trains, or planes, which uses fossil fuels for fuel and for cooling to keep foods in transit from spoiling. </li>
                    <li>Reduce food waste</li>
                    <li>Compost your food</li>
                </ul>
    
            <h3>Shopping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy less stuff</li>
                    <li>Bring your own recycleable bag</li>
                    <li>When shopping for appliances look for energy efficent products</li>
                    <li>Support economically responsible companies</li>
                </ul>
        
            <h3>Home</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Use LED lightbulbs. Although LED lightbulbs cost more than compact fluorescent lamo(CFL), LED uses a quarter of the energy and last 25 times longer</li>
                    <li>Turn off lights when leaving the room</li>
                    <li>Unplug electronic devices when they are not in use</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3> Transportation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drive less</li>
                    <li>Avoid unnecessary acceleration and brakes when driving. Studies have found aggressive driving can result in 40% more fuel consumption than calm driving</li>
                    <li>If financially possible when buying a new car consider purchasing a hybrid or electric cars</li>
                </ul>
