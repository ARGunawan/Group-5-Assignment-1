            The Boiling Point is an educational program that is dedicated in spreading awareness of climate change in an effort to
            impede the growing issue of global warming. With growing greenhouse gas emissions, melting ice caps, deforestation, and ocean accidification on the rise,
            we aim to educate people of all ages in practicing more sustainable efforts. Here on our website, we have listed valid eco friendly companies practicing clean energy,
             the impacts of carbon-footprint, and debunking the myths of climate change. If you wish to support us on our goal to continue spreading awareness of climate change
             please visit our about page to make a donation! We appreciate all the support we can get as all donations will go to fund our educational program!
