        <h1>The Facts and Myths</h1>
        <p>
            Climate change is a very real problem for both the present and future evironmnent as it negatively impacts the eocsystem with each passing day. 
            This can be in the form of decreasing glacier size, rising sea levels,increase in global temperatures, and extreme weather events. The Boiling Point
            is dedicated in spreading awareness to prevent the rapid increase of climate change and to educate on how the rapid mobilization of industry has
            contributed to this growing problem.
        </p>
        
		<h2>The Facts</h2>
		<ol>1. The number of natural disasters have increased since the 1950's due to changes in temperature, causing extreme weather events.</ol>
		<ol>2. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the ocean acidification has increased by 30% due to increase CO2 emissions. </ol>
        <ol>3. The Arctic sea ice and icebergs have steadly decreased in landmass due to increasing temperature.</ol>
        <ol>4. The rate of our oceans increasing in sea level has increased since the last two decades.</ol>
        <ol>5. The Earth's surface temperature has steadly increased since the beginning of the 19th century.</ol>
        <ol>6. Observations from satellites show a decreasing amount of snow cover and an increase in snow melting speed.</ol>
        
        <h3>The Myths</h3>
        <ol>1. Climate change is a natural occurring phenomena and has been seen throughout history.</ol>
        <ol>2. Climate change is not real. It has always been this cold and no one has noticed it.</ol>
        <ol>3. The number of Polar Bears have actually been increasing.</ol>
        <ol>4. Renewable energy will not work due to birds flying into wind turbines and bad weather hindering solar panels.</ol>
        <ol>5. Getting rid of the human population will solve all of our problems.</ol>
        <ol>6. The Earth is flat and therefore all the pollution will just disappear when they get near the edge of the planet.</ol>

        <h4>Debunking the Myths</h4>
        <ol>
            1. While it is true that climate change from eons ago was a naturally occurring event, the rate of our global temperature increasing should normally happen within
            the span of centuries, not decades as seen now.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            2. Climate change is what is causing the Earth's surface temperature to increase. The rise in temperature is what is causing severe droughts and wildfires in drier climate
            countries. The same is true for tropical countries that are currently experiencing more rainfall and flooding than usual due to said temperature increase. Therefore, just
            because it is still currently cold in your area, does not mean that climate change is not occurring.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            3. This is completely false as polar bears have shown a steady decline in population due to their natural habitat being the Arctice has shown a steady decline landmass.
            This makes it difficult for polar bears to hunt for food and mate as their habitat is slowly decreasing with each year. Their main source of foods being seal are also on
            decline due to the decreasing polar ice caps that they rely on.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            4. While there are many recoreded accidents of flocks flying into windturbines, this mainly has to do with visibility rather than the technology itself. In more recent years
            wind turbines blades are being painted black so birds are able to detect and avoid the spinnning blades more easily. As for solar panels being blocked due to cloudy weather,
            electricity from clean energy is always being stored. So, whenever electricity is being used from a renewable source, it gets replenished to clean up the energy supply. 
        </ol>
        <ol>
            5. While is true that advent of industry has caused the rapid increase in climate change, it is our job as inhabitants of the planet to help mitigate the faults of the prevous
            centuries to slowly heal the environment by the removal of harmful practices. This includes fracking, reliance on fossil fuel, deforestation,ocean pollution,
            and increased air pollution in major cities. With the technology that is being developed, renewable energy could soon sustain the Earth and use energy in a cleaner way.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            6. The Earth is not flat satellite modeling and observation clearly show a spherical model inhabiting a solar system. Even if that were the case, climate change would still be in effect
            due to the increase of CO2 emissions and bad energy practices that are still in place from the Industrial Revolution a century ago. Therefore pollution and climate change will not simply "disappear"
            they somehow got magically vaccumed to the edge of a "flat Earth".
