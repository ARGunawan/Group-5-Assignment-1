		<h1>About Global Warming</h1>
		<!--edited on 02/17/21 -->
		<p>Our goal for this project is to bring more attention to global warming. Given that majority of the world has switched over to online to keep in line with the social distancing laws, now is the time to work on our carbon footprint. Traveling isn't happening as much as it used to and being outdoors in wide spaces is encouraged more now than ever. Why not use this time to take care of the environment?</p>

		<p>There are already movements to help replenish the trees that we have lost and to find more ecofriendly solutions to our everyday problems. Why not donate some money to rebuild some of the most spectacular scenary we have? In a way, we are investing in the future when the world finally opens up again.</p>
